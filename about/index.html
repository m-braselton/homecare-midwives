        <p>Hi, my name is Ashley Braselton,
       I live in Midpines California and have just completed a course in midwifery. I am no stranger to home births. I am the product of being born at home and I have 4 children who were born at home. I have been interested in being a midwife for many years.
       I have the good fortune of working in close relation with one of our local doctors and have a very good friend who has been a midwife for many years. Through the classes I just finished, I now have a long list of contacts that helps keep me updated on procedures, articles, and legalities.
       What I like most about birthing at home is the freedom I have there to make the decisions that are important to me. Being at home is the most comfortable place I know and the most loving environment. To me, it is the perfect place to introduce a new baby to this world.
       I would be happy to answer any questions that you have pertaining to the birthing process, regardless of where you choose to have your baby.</p>
